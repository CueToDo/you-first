    <h1>Public support for PR</h1>

    "The United Kingdom uses a First Past the Post voting system, whereby the candidate with the highest number of votes
    in a given constituency wins a seat in Parliament. To what extent, if at all, would you support or oppose the United
    Kingdom switching to a Proportional Representation voting system, whereby parties are assigned a number of seats
    based on the percentage of votes acquired nationally?"

    54% support, 16% oppose

    <h1>The integrity of our democracy is vital and must be defended.</h1>

    <p> ... as you know, a UK Government MP has put forward the view that legislation should be amended so that a
        regulatory policy statement, setting out the Electoral Commission’s remit and goals, would be published by the
        government of the day. It has also been suggested that without reform to its governance, the Commission could be
        abolished.</p>
    <p>I share your concern about any plans of this nature, which I believe would be a harmful and worrying step for the
        integrity of our democracy. I am concerned that removing the Electoral Commission could be part of a concerted
        strategy to remove scrutiny and proper accountability.</p>
    <p>The integrity of our democracy is vital and must be defended. The Electoral Commission is responsible for
        ensuring elections and referendums are run effectively and fairly, in accordance with the law. I am concerned
        that any move to restrict the Commission could undermine faith in our democracy.</p>
    <p>Instead, I support increasing the financial penalties available to the Electoral Commission and believe it should
        be given stronger powers to investigate breaches of electoral law. </p>

    <h1>Our elections watchdog needs strengthening, not scrapping</h1>

    <p>
        So the <strong>Electoral Reform Society</strong> is concerned about the <strong>Electoral Commission</strong>
        being in the Conservative Party’s
        firing line?
    </p>

    <p>
        Yah de yah, why should anyone care?
    </p>

    <p>
        Well, it’s yet another way in which those in power seek to remain in power and undermine our very fragile
        “democracy”
    </p>

    <p>
        Without an <strong>independent commission</strong>, the government would be left to <strong>“mark their own
            homework”</strong> and are unlikely to
        see any fault in disinformation, manipulation and all the dodgy underhand tactics they’ll use to stay in power.

    <h1>Demand Better</h1>

    <p>
        What does the UK have in common with ‘Europe’s last dictatorship’, Belarus?
    </p>

    <p>
        Although the majority of countries in Europe now use some form of proportional representation (in which the
        share of seats a party wins matches the share of votes it receives) for general elections, the UK and Belarus
        remain the only countries to use First Past the Post.
    </p>

    <p>
        Given that Belarus is far from being a substantive democracy, this does not reflect well on the UK.
    </p>

    <h1>Proportional Representation:
        <br />What does proportional really mean?
    </h1>
    <div>

        <p>
            Proportional simply means that one thing relates directly to another.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if 1 litre of petrol costs £1 then 2 litres costs £2. Price is proportional to the volume of
            petrol
            bought.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you get paid £10 for 1 hour of work, then you should get paid £20 for 2 hours of work. Pay Is
            proportional to
            the number of hours worked.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, in parliament the number of MPs elected for a party is NOT proportional to the number of votes cast
            for
            that party. We have a first past the post voting system. We do NOT have proportional representation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Imagine if we introduced First Past The Post <strong><i>Pay</i></strong>. Say you worked 30 hours one week,
            but your colleague
            worked 40
            hours. In a First Past The Post Pay system where the winner takes all, your colleague gets all the pay and
            you
            get nothing. Would that be fair? Of course not. Each person should be paid in proportion to the number of
            hours
            they work.
        </p>
        <p>
            So how fair is a “winner takes all” first-past-the-post voting system?
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, it’s not!
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s time that the number of MPs elected for a party is proportional to the number of votes cast.
        </p>
        <h2>
            We need proportional representation now.
