    <h1>Our elections watchdog needs strengthening, not scrapping</h1>

    <p>
        So the <strong>Electoral Reform Society</strong> is concerned about the <strong>Electoral Commission</strong>
        being in the Conservative Party’s
        firing line?
    </p>

    <p>
        Yah de yah, why should anyone care?
    </p>

    <p>
        Well, it’s yet another way in which those in power seek to remain in power and undermine our very fragile
        “democracy”
    </p>

    <p>
        Without an <strong>independent commission</strong>, the government would be left to <strong>“mark their own
            homework”</strong> and are unlikely to
        see any fault in disinformation, manipulation and all the dodgy underhand tactics they’ll use to stay in power.

    <p>
        What does the UK have in common with ‘Europe’s last dictatorship’, Belarus?
    </p>

    <p>
        Although the majority of countries in Europe now use some form of proportional representation (in which the
        share of seats a party wins matches the share of votes it receives) for general elections, the UK and Belarus
        remain the only countries to use First Past the Post.
    </p>

    <p>
        Given that Belarus is far from being a substantive democracy, this does not reflect well on the UK.

    <h1>Proportional Representation:
        <br />What does proportional really mean?</h1>
    <div>

        <p>
            Proportional simply means that one thing relates directly to another.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if 1 litre of petrol costs £1 then 2 litres costs £2. Price is proportional to the volume of
            petrol
            bought.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you get paid £10 for 1 hour of work, then you should get paid £20 for 2 hours of work. Pay Is
            proportional to
            the number of hours worked.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, in parliament the number of MPs elected for a party is NOT proportional to the number of votes cast
            for
            that party. We have a first past the post voting system. We do NOT have proportional representation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Imagine if we introduced First Past The Post <strong><i>Pay</i></strong>. Say you worked 30 hours one week,
            but your colleague
            worked 40
            hours. In a First Past The Post Pay system where the winner takes all, your colleague gets all the pay and
            you
            get nothing. Would that be fair? Of course not. Each person should be paid in proportion to the number of
            hours
            they work.
        </p>
        <p>
            So how fair is a “winner takes all” first-past-the-post voting system?
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, it’s not!
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s time that the number of MPs elected for a party is proportional to the number of votes cast.
        </p>
